 * @constructor Creates a readable channel that reads each [ByteString] from the provided

   * Reads bytes from the [ReceiveChannel] and transfers them into the provided buffer. If there are
   * leftover bytes from a previous read that didnâ€™t fit in the buffer, they are written first.
   *
   * When the [ReceiveChannel] has no data available:
   * - Returns `0` if the channel is open but temporarily empty, allowing the caller to retry later.
   * - Returns `-1` if the channel is closed and no more data will arrive.
   *
   * If only part of a [ByteString] fits into `destination`, the unread portion is saved for future
   * reads, ensuring data is preserved between calls.
   *
   * @param destination The [ByteBuffer] where data will be written.
   * @return The number of bytes written to `destination`, `0` if no data is available, or `-1` if
   *   the channel is closed and all data has been read.
